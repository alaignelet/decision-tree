# decision-tree
The purpose of the "decision_tree.py" is to be executed in command line:
 - Open the file, and change the variable "path" to put the path of your hidden dataset. Save the file.
 - Open a terminal, cd to this folder, and execute "$python decision_trees.py". This will execute 10 fold cross-validation on your hidden dataset, and output the mean accuracy before and after pruning.
 - If you have enough execution time ahead (appr. 20 minutes), you can set the "got_time" var to "True", which will run 10 fold cross validation on more combinations of test/training/validation data.

 The jupyter notebook "Decision Trees CW - CO395.ipynb" contains the same code as the raw python file, but presented in a more readable way, and already executed with examples.
